# ðŸ™ƒ Moving Target

Python script to perform a Google/Youtube searches.  Testing wheather those services get confused and become unable to target/profile me.

# program structure

Thinking of having an (for the time being) list of English words, and having a script search the web for a random amount of them.

### env

- `conda create -n googlesearch`
- `conda install python`
- `conda install -c anaconda beautifulsoup4`
- `conda install requests`
- `conda install google`
